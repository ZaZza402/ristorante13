## 🗣️ Handling Common Objections

### "It's too modern for our traditional restaurant"

**Response**: "The design actually honors tradition with its color palette—deep greens and golds—classic Italian restaurant colors. The Georgia serif font is traditional. We've blended timeless elegance with modern functionality."

### "Can we make changes ourselves?"

**Response**: "Absolutely. I'll provide training and documentation. Updating text, images, and hours is straightforward. For major changes, I offer affordable maintenance packages."

### "What about our current website?"

**Response**: "We can migrate any content you want to keep. I'll handle the technical transition smoothly with zero downtime."

### "How do we know it will increase bookings?"

**Response**: "Studies show that 94% of first impressions are design-related. A professional website builds trust. Combined with strategic 'Prenota' buttons and mobile optimization, conversion rates typically increase 30-50%."

### "This seems expensive"

**Response**: "Think of it as an investment, not a cost. If this website helps you book just 2-3 extra tables per week at €50 average, it pays for itself in [X] months. Plus, it works 24/7 promoting your restaurant."
